v0.3: 
2025-11-23. Simplified sunrise, sunset and daylight calculation. Country chooser filters cities works as designed. City choser is only reachable if more than one city is present. Navigation hints are now shown on the main screen.

v0.2:
2025-11-22. Main screen logos and layout ready, city and menu chooser working somehow. No sunrise or sunset data yet included.

v0.1:
2026-06-26. Boiler plate code, splash screen with nice graphics, too much non-working code snippets.
